# ice-sheet-gas-diffusion
MATLAB model code to simulate CO2 or O2/N2 gas diffusion in the Antarctic ice sheet given forcings of accumulation rate, ice thickness, surface temperature, and geothermal heat flow. Download all files to the same directory and operate by opening Integrated_model.m and defining the Input Parameters.

This code is used in the Sailer et al. (in review) paper "Ice core site considerations from modeling CO2 and O2/N2 ratio diffusion in interior East Antarctica."
